# CLI Tool

Workflow:

* [ ] Enumerate every single possible domain for a specific company or organization (through mutation, example: `intigriti.com`, `intigriti.eu`, `intigriti.be`, etc.)
* [ ] Send request and verify response against strict patterns to detect a possible lead to the misconfiguration.

# Introduction

Service Scanner is a project by Intigriti for the community to help you find, detect and resolve common security misconfigurations in various popular services, technologies and SaaS-based solutions that your targets use!

Service Scanner consists out of 2 parts, the Documentation and the Scanner.

## Documentation:

The documentation has all the known misconfigured services documented. Each section or service has its own misconfigurations listed.

Each page is further divided into 5 separate sections; "Description", "Testing", "Remediation", "Potential Impact" and "References" (if any).

## Scanner:

The open-source scanner that is written in Golang is designed to help you automate finding or detecting almost all common security misconfigurations!

Some features include:

* Automatic target enumeration (via permutations)
* Template-based (easy configuration of new services)
* Passive-only tests

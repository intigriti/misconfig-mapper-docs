# Salesforce Misconfigured Objects

#### Description:

Salesforce is an extensive CRM software that also provides several programming technologies like Objects. [Objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_concepts.htm) are data tables that can be used to store data in fields.

Access to these (custom) Objects can be configured incorrectly and allow unauthorized users to read more data than allowed.

Salesforce allows organizations and admins to configure (custom) objects using Controllers. [Controllers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.pages.meta/pages/pages_controller.htm) are like functions that can be defined to manage Objects. Incorrectly configuring a Controller can introduce broken access control security vulnerabilities.
